<p>A bit about my journey. I started working in Astronomy at the end of college and continued for several years after. I loved learning about stars and thinking about big ideas related to our place in the Universe. Working in astronomy, I learned how to use programming to analyze data. I'm grateful to mentors like Tim Anderton, Inese Ivans, and Anil Seth for helping me along that journey. Especially, Tim who introduced me to this thing call "Python" which changed my life.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I left Astronomy to work on something a little more down to Earth and joined a startup called Teem (then called EventBoard) as a backend web developer using Python. I learned about this thing called "Data Science" which was close to what I had done in Astronomy and gravitated towards it. I'm especially grateful to Joe Reis and Ken Meyers who taught me so much as we built the data products at Teem which provided facilities managers insights into how their spaces were being used.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 2018, Teem was aquired by WeWork and I was propelled into a new level of the startup world. At the time WeWork could not grow fast enough and we were immediately set to hiring. I took the opportunity there to advocate for product metrics and hire several analysts which I led to building out internal product metrics across all of Teem's products. Within several months we were able to build out a pipeline and start iterating on metrics which improved quality and helped the business calibrate. During this time WeWork tried to go public and many of it's hidden secrets became known and brought that company to it's knees. WeWork sold off Teem and I choose to leave to try out my hand at new challenges.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I joined Verdigris with the opportunity to build out an machine learning platform and product which optimizes energy usage for buildings. This combined a long time passion for sustainability with my knowledge of data and software development. The future of smart buildings is coming and being a part of that journey is exciting.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I'm looking forward to where life takes me next. Very grateful to the people and opportunities along the way.</p>
